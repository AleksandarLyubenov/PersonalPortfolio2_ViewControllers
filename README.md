# View Controllers in VR

This project was made for the 2nd Quartile iteration of the CMGT course Personal Portfolio in Year 2 of the study. This time around, I focused on making a VR game, inspired by Horseshoes, Hotdogs and Handgrenades to learn how different view/movement mechanics and types influence the user (motion sickness). This project also allowed me to create a working gun system that is very fun to use and taught me how to use grab interactables and how the XR Toolkit for Unity works in general.

The build only runs on OpenXR, so it can be used with any headset, proven it's plugged in. I did not make a standalone Oculus build (but I did make a Meta developer account for purposes of using the Quest 2 as a development tool/kit) so it would not be hard to create a standalone build when or if required. 

Despite not making a build, I made sure that the builds themselves fit within the Quest 2's resources via way of optimization by tracking the profiler, debug logs in builds and simplifying scripts wherever possible.
